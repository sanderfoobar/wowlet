The wallet UI is heavily inspired by Electrum. We would like to recognize Thomas Voegtlin for his pioneering work on Bitcoin.

Feather uses monero-seed written by Tevador, for 14 word mnemonic seeds.

Wizard banner art was adapted from a paper wallet design by the themonera (themonera.art).

Initial CMake support for the Monero GUI was coded by TheCharlatan/xiphon.

Huge thanks to nioc, fluffypony, wowario, thrmo for help during development.
